## Review
#### Learning rate

learning rate determines how fast you get to optimal solution

when implementing in python, we'll translate `10^-1` notation to `1e-1`:

notation | python | decimal
---------|--------|---------
`10^-1`  | `1e-1` | 0.1
`10^-2`  | `1e-2` | 0.01

Find the lowest point, and go back (left) by 1 order of magnitude (10x):

Lowest point: 0.1

A good learning rate: 0.01 (or 0.001 if 0.01 doesn't work well)

If you've made changes to the neural network (eg unfreezing layers), you should re-run learning rate finder.

## How to improve your model and avoid overfitting:

With many parameters, a neural net will start to tailor itself for the training set (like rote memorization), instead of taking the lesson & applying it elsewhere (generalization).

The best solution is to give it more data.

But an easier & cheaper solution is data augmentation.

## Data augmentation
Data augmentation means applying small transformations to the data. For cats & dogs images, for example, zoom in a bit, rotate slightly, or flip horizontally.

This artificially inflates the amount of data you have.

The type of augmentation should be different for different types of data. For example, to recognize letters & digits, it wouldn't make sense to flip them horizontally. While it makes sense to flip satellite images vertically.

Augmentation is applied on this line:

```python
ImageClassifierData.from_paths(PATH, tfms=tfms_from_model(arch, sz))
```

We can specify the transformations we want to do:

<pre lang="python">
tfms = tfms_from_model(arch, sz, <strong>aug_tfms=transforms_side_on, max_zoom=1.1</strong>)
data = ImageClassifierData.from_paths(PATH, <strong>tfms=tfms</strong>)
</pre>

`transforms_side_on`: for photos taken from the side. ie, side view of an object. Applies horizontal flips, slight rotations, slight zooms, small translations, or varied brightness & contrast.

## More on learning rate
### Learning rate annealing
Decrease learning rate as you train, so you don't overshoot minimum.

Step decay of learning rate:

### Cosine annealing
The rate of decrease follows one-half of a cosine curve. ie, stay on high lr when you're still far away (from the minimum), then quickly decrease lr when you get close.

### What's a good minimum?
Not all minima are created equal. Some generalize better, while others, don't.


A bowl-shaped, wide & deep minimum is preferred. When a different dataset is used, the [loss landscape](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/landscapes/) might translate laterally. A deep & wide minimum will generalizes better, verses a deep but narrow minimum.

What does "generailze better" mean?

It means that given the same parameters, changes in input do not result in a large change in loss.

We need to *jump* out of the local minimum to see if there are other, better minima out there.

To jump, we can periodically bump up the learning rate to escape a local minimum. This is known as SGD with restarts.

### Cyclic learning rate
The learning rate over time looks like this:

When setting a learning rate with `lr_find`, it's important not to pick too low of a learning rate. Our lr will define the upper bound of our learning rate schedule. If it is too low, we'll have a difficult time escaping a sharp minimum.
