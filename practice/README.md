Practice by making a copy of the `xxx-Blank.ipynb` notebooks. If you get stuck, refer to `xxx-Answer.ipynb`.

Then practice by starting a completely new, blank notebook. The only lines you can copy are the magic methods that set autoreload and matplotlib inline:

```
# Put these at the top of every notebook to get automatic reloading and inline plotting
%reload_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
%matplotlib inline
```

The goal is to be able to recreate the answer notebooks without peaking.
